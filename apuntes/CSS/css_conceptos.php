            Littering a dark and dreary road lay 
            the past relics of browser-specific tags, 
            incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and 
            abandoned browsers.
            We must clear the mind of the past. 
            Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks 
            to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, 
            WASP, and the major browser creators.
